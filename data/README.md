# `data/`

This folder contains the raw dataset files used in this project. Since the files are large, they are not included in the repository. Instead, you can download them from [this link](http://cicresearch.ca/CICDataset/CIC-IDS-2017/Dataset/CIC-IDS-2017/CSVs/).

### Files:
- Dataset 1: `Monday-WorkingHours.pcap_ISCX.csv`: Captures normal web traffic (no attacks).
- Dataset 2: `Wednesday-workingHours.pcap_ISCX.csv`: Captures mixed traffic containing both benign and various cyberattacks.

### Notes:
- These files come from the [CIC-IDS2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) dataset by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity.
- These datasets are **not modified** here. Any preprocessing is done within the scripts or notebooks.
