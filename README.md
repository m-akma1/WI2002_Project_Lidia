## Network Traffic Analysis for Attack Detection
Project Data Literacy and AI using CIC-IDS2017 Dataset.

This is a major project for the WI2002 Data Literacy and AI course at ITB. It uses the CIC-IDS2017 dataset to analyze web server traffic and detect anomalous behavior using flow-level network features. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization of network traffic patterns. 

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw dataset CSV files
- `notebook/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and visualization
- `script/`: Python scripts for automation
- `output/`: Generated statistics and visual plots
- `doc/`: Written reports and documentation
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebook/` directory to explore the dataset and visualize network traffic patterns.

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook/
```
