# `notebook/`

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks used throughout the analysis.

### Expected notebooks:
- `01_data_cleaning.ipynb`: Preprocessing and data validation
- `02_statistical_summary.ipynb`: Descriptive statistics and data profiling
- `03_visualization.ipynb`: Time-series and distributional plots
- `04_modeling.ipynb`: Optional regression/classification

Each notebook should be clear, annotated, and executable independently.
